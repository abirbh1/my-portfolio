I took part in the national event Tunisian Digital Summit—a major gathering of companies, startups, and innovation leaders. (You can find a photo of me with the team in the hackathons section.) Together with my team, we developed an impactful solution to help integrate deaf individuals into the job market. Our project was a recruitment and freelance platform specifically designed for this community. We presented our idea to a wide audience, emphasizing its social impact and potential. The project was recognized and awarded, and we became winners of the event.
