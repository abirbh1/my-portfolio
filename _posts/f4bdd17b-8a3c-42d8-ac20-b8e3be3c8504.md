This year, I had the opportunity to present my latest research on auction based procurement of truckload transportation services —a topic I’m deeply passionate about.

It was an incredibly insightful experience to engage with a community of distinguished researchers and professionals, each bringing a wealth of knowledge and expertise. From attending thought-provoking sessions to building meaningful connections, every moment contributed to enriching my perspective and pushing me forward in my research journey.

Excited for what’s next and looking forward to more opportunities to grow and contribute in this dynamic field.
